        <h2 class="page-title">What is Cataract?</h2>

        <section class="content-section">
<p>
    A cataract is a condition where the natural lens inside the eye becomes cloudy, preventing
    light from entering the eye clearly. The lens normally works like a transparent glass
    that focuses light onto the retina to create sharp, clear vision. When a cataract forms,
    this lens gradually loses its transparency and becomes foggy or opaque. As a result,
    vision slowly becomes blurry, hazy, dim, or distorted.
</p> </br>

<p>
    Cataracts usually develop slowly over many years and are most commonly related to aging.
    However, they can also occur earlier in life due to medical conditions like diabetes,
    long-term use of steroid medications, eye injuries, infections, or genetic factors.
    Extended exposure to sunlight (UV rays), smoking, and poor nutrition may further speed
    up cataract formation.
</p> </br>

<p>
    In the early stages, cataracts may not cause noticeable symptoms. Over time, the clouding
    becomes dense enough to interfere with everyday activities such as reading, driving,
    recognizing faces, or seeing clearly in bright sunlight. Colors may start to appear dull,
    lights may seem too bright, and night vision becomes difficult due to glare and halos.
</p> </br>

<p>
    Cataracts are very common and one of the leading causes of preventable blindness worldwide.
    Fortunately, modern cataract treatment is extremely safe and effective. Surgery involves
    removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with a clear artificial lens, restoring sharp
    vision and improving quality of life. Since cataracts do not improve on their own and
    cannot be treated with medicines or glasses, surgery remains the only permanent solution.
